# Onboarding Improvements

## Overview
Enhanced the onboarding experience with detailed instructions and comprehensive code templates for 11 different languages and frameworks.

## What Was Changed

### 1. Expanded Code Templates
Previously had only 4 basic examples. Now includes **11 comprehensive templates**:

#### Backend Frameworks
1. **Node.js + Express** - Popular JavaScript backend
2. **Next.js API Routes** - Both Pages Router and App Router
3. **Python + Flask** - Lightweight Python framework
4. **Python + FastAPI** - Modern async Python framework
5. **Go + Gin** - Popular Go web framework
6. **Go Standard Library** - Pure Go, no dependencies
7. **Ruby on Rails** - Full-stack Ruby framework
8. **Ruby + Sinatra** - Lightweight Ruby framework
9. **PHP + Laravel** - Popular PHP framework
10. **.NET / C#** - ASP.NET Core (both minimal API and controller)
11. **Java + Spring Boot** - Enterprise Java framework

### 2. Enhanced Code Templates Features

Each template now includes:
- ✅ **Complete, copy-paste ready code** with comments
- ✅ **Installation commands** (e.g., `npm install express`)
- ✅ **File locations** (e.g., "Create pages/api/health.js")
- ✅ **Import statements** and dependencies
- ✅ **Memory tracking** implementation
- ✅ **Uptime calculation** from server start
- ✅ **Environment variable** handling
- ✅ **Proper JSON response** structure
- ✅ **Framework-specific best practices**

### 3. Step-by-Step Setup Instructions

Each framework has a **5-step setup guide**:
```
1. Install dependencies (exact command)
2. Create or open specific file
3. Copy the health check code
4. Run the application
5. Test the endpoint (with curl command)
```

### 4. Improved Step 1 (Health Endpoint)

**New Features:**
- 📋 **Clear instructions banner** explaining what users need to do
- 🎯 **Framework selection grid** with better visual hierarchy
- 💻 **Code template** with syntax highlighting
- ⚙️ **Setup instructions** specific to each framework
- 💡 **Smart tips section**:
  - Monitoring frequency (every 30 seconds)
  - Endpoint must be publicly accessible
  - Expected JSON response format

**Visual Improvements:**
- Larger, more readable code blocks
- Framework cards show full names (not just language)
- Copy button more prominent
- Color-coded information boxes (blue tips, yellow warnings, green success)

### 5. Improved Step 2 (Service URL)

**New Features:**
- 🔗 **Context explanation** of what the URL should be
- ✅ **Real-time URL validation**
  - Checks for http:// or https://
  - Shows error if invalid format
  - Shows success when valid
- 📋 **Framework-specific URL examples**
  - Dynamically shows common hosting patterns for selected framework
  - Node.js: Vercel, Heroku examples
  - Python: Fly.io, Heroku examples
  - Go: Fly.io, Railway examples
  - .NET: Azure examples, etc.
- ⚡ **Pre-flight checklist**:
  - Service deployed and running
  - Endpoint publicly accessible
  - Returns JSON (not HTML)
  - Can test with browser/curl

### 6. Better User Guidance

**Visual Hierarchy:**
- 📋 Clear section headers with emoji icons
- Color-coded information boxes:
  - 🔵 Cyan = Tips and information
  - 🟡 Yellow = Important warnings
  - 🟢 Green = Success confirmations
  - 🔴 Red = Errors and validation issues

**Progressive Disclosure:**
- Only show validation when user starts typing
- Framework-specific examples based on their Step 1 choice
- Clear visual feedback at each step

### 7. Code Quality

Each template includes:
- **Error handling** where appropriate
- **Resource cleanup** (memory stats, process info)
- **Standard response format**:
  ```json
  {
    "status": "UP",
    "timestamp": "2025-10-01T12:00:00Z",
    "service": "my-service",
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "uptime": 3600,
    "memory": { "used_mb": 256 },
    "environment": "production"
  }
  ```

## Implementation Details

### Data Structure
```javascript
codeExamples = {
  'framework-key': {
    name: 'Display Name',
    description: 'Short description',
    code: 'Complete code template...',
    setup: ['Step 1', 'Step 2', ...]
  }
}
```

### Framework Keys
- `node-express`
- `node-nextjs`
- `python-flask`
- `python-fastapi`
- `go-gin`
- `go-standard`
- `ruby-rails`
- `ruby-sinatra`
- `php-laravel`
- `dotnet`
- `java-spring`

## User Experience Flow

1. **User arrives at Step 1**
   - Sees clear instructions: "What you need to do"
   - Selects their framework from grid
   - Reviews code template with comments
   - Reads setup instructions
   - Copies code
   - Sees important tips about accessibility and response format

2. **User moves to Step 2**
   - Sees explanation of what URL to enter
   - Gets framework-specific hosting examples
   - Enters their URL
   - Gets immediate validation feedback
   - Sees pre-flight checklist
   - Confident to proceed

3. **Remaining Steps**
   - Steps 3-5 unchanged (app name, theme, email alerts)
   - User completes onboarding with full understanding
